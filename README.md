# Mathematics Papers

**Hi there! 👋**

This repository gathers my mathematical notes, practice, experiments, labs and worked papers covering the core foundations required for modern data science and machine learning. Jupyter is used as an appropriated tool here for its cells of code and markdown LaTex demonstrations, interpretations of results.

The focus is deliberately placed on understanding first principles rather than relying on black-box tools. Topics are developed from definitions and geometry to optimization and probabilistic reasoning, with an emphasis on clarity, rigor, and interpretability.

The material spans:
linear algebra and geometry, convex optimization, analysis and regularization,   probability theory and statistical inference, and mathematical foundations of learning algorithms.

Each folder contains structured notes, derivations, and illustrative examples or casestudy, often connected to practical models such as linear classifiers, SVMs, stochastic gradient descent, graph-based processes, and regression.

This repository serves as a conceptual support for more applied projects, ensuring that models and algorithms are grounded in solid mathematical reasoning.
